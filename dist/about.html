          <h6>May, 2020 to Present</h6>

            provides solutions for patient outreach, answering services and
            appointment handling, insurance verification, and other unique
            services to dental offices. I worked alongside FANG-experienced
            engineers on internal tools, such as an employee console for
            handling appointments and a list-filtering software that would
            orgnanize patient records into csvs, for our callers to contact, as
            well as an external, client-facing portal for our customers to view
            their patient's appointments through our services.
          </p>
          <strong>Skills</strong>
          <ul class="about-bullets">
            <li>
              Underwent HIPAA compliance training for adequately handling patient-sensitive data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Emphatically used React, Node, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform technologies (BigQuery, CRON jobs through Pubsubs, storage, VM instances, cloud-functions), SQL, Material-UI, Tailwind, and 
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved the readability of my code from learning alongside Adobee and Amazon engineers who gave constructive feedback on my PRs.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Accomplishments</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Client offered $20,000 to have a custom built insurance verification table in the client-portal for viewing statuses of patient insurances. I completed this in 2 days.
              </li>
              <li>
                Uncovered and fixed buggy code, not related to my assignments, that prevented Callforce's notification system (email and SMS updates) from working properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created better, structured <a href='https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/structured-logging#:~:text=In%20Cloud%20Logging%2C%20structured%20logs,the%20structure%20of%20your%20payloads.' target='_blank'></a>google cloud logs, outside of my assignments, for better error visibility in our more frequently used cloud-functions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Projects</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>DSO (Dental Service Organization) List Filtering Electron
              Application</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Built an electron application for DSOs that filtered, sorted,
                  and consolidated millions of patient records based on shared
                  phone numbers and outputed office-specific csvs.
                </li>
               
                <li>
                  Patient records were consolidated based on
                  their primary phone numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Filtered by either pediatric/non-pediatric requirements
                  (age-ranges), if patient had medicare, if patient was overdue
                  for an appointment (often over 6 months since last
                  appointment), and etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sorted by age for conslidated patient records once groupings
                  of shared phone numbers were identified.
                </li>
              
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>Dental Office List Filtering Cloud-Functions for Practice Management Softwares</strong> 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Built cloud-functions to support non-DSO dental office list
                  filtering that returned csvs that would then be uploaded into
                  the
                  <strong><a href="https://www.five9.com/" target='_blank'>five9</a></strong>
                  queue for callers to call upon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The supported Practice Management Softwares supported in these list-filtering cloud-functions: Curve, Denticon, Dentrix, DentrixAscend, EagleSoft, Open Dental, Mac Practice, and Practice Works.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Multiple scenes constructed for sole office list handling
                  within our internal console that supported many list uploads
                  simultaneously. Lists would be uploaded, requested to a
                  cloud-function to be sorted/filtered/consolidated, and would
                  be filtered by utility functions specific to the PMS (Practice
                  Management Software - e.g. Dentrix) that generated the patient
                  list.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Effect: Reduced operation overhead by supporting multiple
                  lists filtering simultaneously, dividing DSO lists into
                  office-level csvs for better accountability and handling among
                  teams, prevented multiple calls on the same patient, and
                  greatly sped up production of calls by eliminating filtering
                  by hand.
