          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <h6>Full Stack Web Developer</h6>
          <p>I began studying web development a year ago as a self-learner.  I signed up with a Team Treehouse account, started designing my first website, 'DroneBug360' within just a few weeks, and began diving further into self-study of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript upon completing my first website and uploading new content. As I began uploading more and more content, I became fascinated with how content was displayed and interacted with online and decided to further my Web Dev education by attending a coding bootcamp, DevMountain, in the city of Provo, Utah.  </p>
