            provides solutions for patient outreach, answering services and
            appointment handling, insurance verification, and other unique
            services to dental offices. I worked alongside FANG-experienced
            engineers on internal tools, such as an employee console for
            handling appointments and a list-filtering software that would
            orgnanize patient records into csvs, for our callers to contact, as
            well as an external, client-facing portal for our customers to view
            their patient's appointments through our services.
          </p>
          <strong>Skills</strong>
          <ul class="about-bullets">
            <li>
              Underwent HIPAA compliance training for adequately handling

            <li>
              Emphatically used React, Node, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform
              technologies (BigQuery, CRON jobs through Pubsubs, storage, VM
              instances, cloud-functions), SQL, Material-UI, and Tailwind.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved the readability of my code from learning alongside Adobe
              and Amazon engineers who gave constructive feedback on my PRs.

          <ul class="about-bullets">
            <li>
              Client offered $20,000 to have a custom built insurance
              verification table in the client-portal for viewing statuses of
              patient insurances. We created a satisfactory table within a deadline of two days.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uncovered and fixed buggy code that prevented Callforce's notification system (email and SMS
              updates) from working properly.

          <strong>Projects</strong>
          <li><em>Client Portal</em></li>
          React-based web application that communicated with our nonSQL
          firestore DB through Google's Firebase SDK. It was built with Tailwind
          as a UI library for a cleaner, modern look for Callforce's clients.
          Clients could view appointments that were scheduled, see notes and
          action items (e.g. a patient could ask for the office to call them
          back about insurance and the client could mark that as an action
          taken.) from callers who had contacted patients, listen to voicemails,
          edit contact information as well as notifications pertaining to the
          services we offer (e.g. 'Receive texts and emails whenever a new
          patient is scheduled')
          <ul class="about-bullets">
            <li>
              Built out the frontend alone and hit our MVP deadline of 2 months.
              Mockups were provided to me by our CTO.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leveraged localForage for client-side caching of nonsensitive data
              for better performance boost.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unlike the previous portal design, this one supported
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_Service_Organizations#:~:text=Dental%20Service%20Organizations%2C%20known%20in,%2C%20including%20non%2Dclinical%20operations."

                ><strong>DSO</strong></a
              >
              accounts which needed access to many offices. Callforce's previous
              portal suffered many performance issues and wasn't architected in
              a way that could support that sort of overview.

          <li>
            <em>DSO List Filtering Electron Application</em>
            <ul class="about-bullets">
              <li>
                An electron application for DSOs that filtered, sorted, and
                consolidated millions of patient records based on shared phone
                numbers and outputed office-specific csvs.
              </li>
              <li>Built this as a solo project with a deadline of 2 weeks.</li>
              <li>
                Effect: Reduced operation overhead by supporting multiple lists
                filtering simultaneously, dividing DSO lists into office-level
                csvs for better accountability and handling among teams,
                prevented multiple calls on the same patient, and greatly sped
                up production of calls by eliminating filtering by hand.
              </li>

            <ul class="about-bullets">
              <li>
                Built cloud-functions to support non-DSO dental office list
                filtering that returned csvs that would then be uploaded into
                the

              </li>
              <li>
                These filters would also track list sizes, before and after
                filtering, and post them to our firebase DB. These list sizes
                would then be mirrored in our SQL BigQuery tables which are then
                visualized in Tableau for better visibility of listSizes by
                office.
              </li>
              <li>
                The supported Practice Management Softwares in these
                list-filtering cloud-functions are Curve, Denticon, Dentrix,
                DentrixAscend, EagleSoft, Open Dental, Mac Practice, and
                Practice Works.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built PubSub functions that request Five9 reports, using SOAP,
                of our inbound and outbound call logs every 5 minutes, every
                work day from 8AM to 10PM, so Callforce's VP of operations and
                his analysts can have a live feed of our daily Call Volume.
              </li>
              <li>
                Call volume data is stored in our BigQuery tables, along with
                listSizes, which is connected to our VP's tableau account for
                data visualization. Essentialy, because of these features and
                the data I was able to format and store, our operations VP has
                instant access to the state of each caller's progress throughout
                the day in nearly real-time.
