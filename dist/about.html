          <h3>Snug Music Lessons</h3>
          <h5>Music Instructor</h5>
          <h6>March, 2016 to June, 2018</h6>
          <p  class="about-descriptions">Started small business in March, 2016, with the aim to promote musical growth for students of all ages by teaching guitar, bass guitar, and piano. Since its birth, its client base grew up to 20 clients within a year and half through ‘word of mouth’ and online advertisement. Duties included crafting weekly agendas tailored to each student’s needs and desires based on their respective musical aspirations while logging their progress via Pro-Tools library, ensuring each student is engaged with their instrument and is goal-oriented within their preferred genres of music while exposing them to new styles of playing, recording students as they perform benchmark pieces from their recital books and give criticism that is equally constructive, critical, and welcoming. </p>
