        <h3>Callforce</h3>

        <p  class="about-descriptions">
          <strong><a href='https://www.getcallforce.com/' target='_blank'>Callforce </a></strong> provides solutions for patient outreach, answering services and appointment handling, insurance verification, and other unique services to dental offices.  I worked alongside FANG-experienced engineers on internal tools, such as an employee console for handling appointments and a list-filtering software that would orgnanize patient records into csvs, for our callers to contact, as well as an external, client-facing portal for our customers to view appointments that required urgent attention.

            Built an electron application that filtered millions of patient records based on shared phone numbers, and consolidated them into single records with the oldest patient serving as the primary call-recepient. This software would organize all patients from tens to hundreds of offices under a single umbrella company, a DSO, within a single XLSX file and output office-specific csvs with all patients consolidated to preclude multiple calls to the same phone number in a single execution. The effect of this software reduced operation overhead by dividing up our lists for teams to better manage, prevented multiple calls to the same patient, and provided better accountability for tracking which offices were receiving inadequate attention.

            Our online applications leveraged the firebase SDK and its nonSQL database; however, as indexes for sorting queries became fewer, we relied more heavily on Google's BigQuery firebase extension for exporting our data into SQL-tables. Consequently, I have a lot of experience writing cloud-functions (onRequests, onCalls, pubsubs, and etc.), writing queries for non-SQL as well as SQL databases, and
