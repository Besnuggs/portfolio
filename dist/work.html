          <p class="description">VR-Art-Gallery is a full stack, mobile-responsive, virtual reality application built in React and deployed in Preact where users can upload images into their own custom art galleries to display to the world. As a user, you customize your two-story gallery with texture presets for the floors and walls, and choose your own gallery music (all songs were performed by Kevin Macleod). Additionally, you can favorite other galleries, share their links, or create private galleries that are only accessible by the link you provide.</p>
