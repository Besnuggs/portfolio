                VR-Art-Gallery is a full stack, mobile-responsive, virtual

                users can upload images into their own custom art galleries to
                display to the world. As a user, you customize your two-story
                gallery with texture presets for the floors and walls, and
                choose your own gallery music (all songs were performed by Kevin
                Macleod). Additionally, you can favorite other galleries, share
                their links, or create private galleries that are only
                accessible by the link you provide.

                server, following the construction of a node server, and to
